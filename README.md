# Goals Tracker App

This application helps you keep track of your daily, weekly, monthly or yearly goals. It does this by not only showing your goals on the DOM but also saving them in the local storage for later. You can add and save as many goals as possible with the click of a button. You can also remove any form field before clicking the submit button. There are 3 buttons attached to each saved goal: The Edit button which helps to update the goal; the Delete button which helps to delete the goal and; the Switch button which switches between an achieved and unachieved goal. Finally, there is the Clear button below all the saved goals which clears the list of goals both from the DOM and local storage.

## Suggested Improvements

One of the weaknesses of this app is that the local storage resides in the browser that is used to open the application. As a result, the goals are only saved in that particular browser and not globally(the device). In the same vein, your goals may not save if the browser storage is full, and so you will need to always ensure you have enough storage space before saving.
